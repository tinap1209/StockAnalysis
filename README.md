## Summary

There are more advantages than disadvantages in Refactoring code. It makes a software system easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable 
behavior by changing its internal structure.
-The purposes of refactoring according to Martin Fowler (Father of Code Smell) are stated in the following:
-Refactoring Improves the Design of Software
-Refactoring Makes Software Easier to Understand
-Refactoring Helps Finding Bugs
-Refactoring Helps Programming Faster
-Specially for long-term software, it is essential to refactor the code in order to make the software more adaptive. 

However, you definitely do not perform refactoring tasks, if it exceeds your budget and time. In essence, stop refactoring when you -
-Run out of money
-Run out of time
-The few disadvantages are that it is expensive and risky in the view of management.
-It may introduce bugs.
-Delivery schedule is very tight.
-Management doesn't care about maintainability and extension of code base.
